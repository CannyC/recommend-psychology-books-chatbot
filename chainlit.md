## Welcome! I'm your guide to the world of psychology literature. ðŸ§ ðŸ“–

Think of me as your personal librarian for psychology books. My goal is to help you navigate a curated collection of 3,000 books to find exactly what you're looking for.

When you ask me for a recommendation, I do my best to understand the heart of your request. I then search through book descriptions and present you with the most relevant matches, complete with their covers to give you a better feel for them.

### How can I help you today?

You can ask me in many ways. The more specific you are, the better my suggestions will be!

**Ask about a specific topic:**

- "Can you recommend books about stoicism?"
- "I'm looking for an introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy."
- "Tell me about books on cognitive biases."

**Describe a goal or a problem:**

- "I need a book to help me build better habits."
- "I want to understand and improve my relationships."
